# AFSC EMA Organization
Welcome to the organization landing page for Ecosystem monitoring and assessment (EMA) at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. 
Here, we house code, products, and packages related to the data and surveys we produce for others to use. This includes data from our integrated ecosystem surveys in the Northern and Southern Bering Sea (2002 - today) and sporadically in Arctic and Gulf of Alaska waters.
